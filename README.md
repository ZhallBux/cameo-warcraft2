Cameo is a third-party OpenRA mod aiming to incorporate content from a wide variety of RTS and other games.

You can download binary releases [here](https://github.com/Zeruel87/Cameo-mod/releases/). However, due to the volume of content added, Cameo is extremely buggy, lacking in properly functioning features, and crash-prone, so updates vital to mod functionality are frequent. Thus, it is recommended that you clone this repository and build from source instead, so updating can be done with minimal effort through pulling or fetching.

Please report bugs and crashes at our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Xn2eSpS) so the mod can be improved further! Feel free to ask questions or offer suggestions too.

The key scripts in this SDK are:

| Windows               | Linux / macOS            | Purpose
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------- |
| make.cmd              | Makefile                 | Compiles the mod and fetches dependencies (including the OpenRA engine).
| launch-game.cmd       | launch-game.sh           | Launches the mod from the SDK directory.
| launch-server.cmd     | launch-server.sh         | Launches a dedicated server for the mod from the SDK directory.
| utility.cmd           | utility.sh         | Launches the OpenRA Utility for the mod.
| &lt;not available&gt; | packaging/package-all.sh | Generates release installers for the mod.

To launch Cameo from the development environment you must first compile the mod by running `make.cmd` (Windows), or opening a terminal in the SDK directory and running `make` (Linux / macOS).  You can then run `launch-game.cmd` (Windows) or `launch-game.sh` (Linux / macOS) to run your game.
